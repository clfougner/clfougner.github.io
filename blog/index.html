Mutational signatures were pioneered by <a href='http://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(12)00528-4?_returnURL=http%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867412005284%3Fshowall%3Dtrue' target='_blank'>Nik-Zainal et al. in 2012</a> and the concept has since become instrumental in the analysis of the etiology of cancer. This blog post shows how a mutational signature analysis can be performed using the deconstructSigs R package, and the adjustments to the source code that need to be made in order to be able to do so on sequence data from mice.

                        Hi, and welcome to my blog! If you've arrived here... you probably came here by accident. In brief, I'm a medical student doing an MD/PhDish program at the University of Oslo at the Department of Cancer Genetics. I'm currently working on sequence data from mouse cancer models, with a focus on tumor progression. Recently, I've been spending far too much time figuring out what should be fairly standard sequence analyses, so I'm starting this blog in an attempt to publicly document some of my work and hopefully be of help to to the next person working through the same issues as myself. Maybe I'll even have an opinion about something at some point too... For now, thanks for visiting!
